    <p>12/21/2016 - Nothing today... Well, so far. Thinking about using unity to program Meme Trail. Also, my school's having a half day tomarrow and I'm off the
      day after that. IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS! Ooh! Idea! I might add a christmas theme to the site! I'll ask Jack Mo. -Owen~<p>
    <p>12/20/2016 - So Um, I guess this is the first News/Blog? Um, in the news today, the News Paragraph/website was first
      edited and posted JUST on this day. Also in the news, today's first project, (Meme Trail) was created. It's first idea is
      being a orgeon trail type game but with MEMES! Thank you for tuning into today's daily news/blog! -Owen~<p>
