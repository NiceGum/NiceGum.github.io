<h1>Daily News/Blog<h1>
    <p>2/15/2017 - Getting bored with the site, plus just totally forgot about the website in general due to the fact that to me it's just a stupid website.
        I've been getting questions from friends, "When's meme trail gonna done?","What's meme trail", "no meme trail = no life" Well, I don't know the answers. I havn't even thought
        about coding the game and all that jazz... (You like jazz?) The real honesty is, IM ADDICTED TO VIDEO GAMES ;( -Owen (I need help)<p>
    <p>1/4/2017 - Just got our chromebooks from school! Happy new years guys, I never the chance to even edit the site... Anyway!
    In the news! Getting prepared for coding the game. I'm searching every website to find what to use. If you know a program I might
  be able to program the game, email me at RoyalNumber163@gmail.com -Owen~<p>
    <p>12/21/2016 - Nothing today... Well, so far. Thinking about using unity to program Meme Trail. Also, my school's having a half day tomarrow and I'm off the
      day after that. IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS! Ooh! Idea! I might add a christmas theme to the site! I'll ask Jack Mo. -Owen~<p>
    <p>12/20/2016 - So Um, I guess this is the first News/Blog? Um, in the news today, the News Paragraph/website was first
      edited and posted JUST on this day. Also in the news, today's first project, (Meme Trail) was created. It's first idea is
      being a orgeon trail type game but with MEMES! Thank you for tuning into today's daily news/blog! -Owen~<p>
